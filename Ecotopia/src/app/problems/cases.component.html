          <li>
            <b>Fighting for trash seas</b>
            <br />
            - Ocean trash affects the health of wildlife, people, and local
            economies. Trash in the water and on the shore can be mistaken as
            food by wildlife or entangle animals with lethal consequences.
            <br />
            - Marine debris isn’t an ocean problem—it’s a people problem. That
            means people are the solution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Marine Pollutions</b>
            <br />
            - Marine pollution is a combination of chemicals and trash, most of
            which comes from land sources and is washed or blown into the ocean.
            <br />
            - Ocean is being flooded with two main types of pollution: chemicals
            and trash.
            <br />
            - Chemical contamination, or nutrient pollution, is concerning for
            health, environmental, and economic reasons. This type of pollution
            occurs when human activities, notably the use of fertilizer on
            farms, lead to the runoff of chemicals into waterways that
            ultimately flow into the ocean.
            <br />
            - Marine trash encompasses all manufactured products—most of them
            plastic—that end up in the ocean. Littering, storm winds, and poor
            waste management all contribute to the accumulation of this debris,
            80 percent of which comes from sources on land.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Marine Plastic Pollutions</b>
            <br />
            - At least 14 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every
            year, and plastic makes up 80% of all marine debris found from
            surface waters to deep-sea sediments.
            <br />
            - Marine species ingest or are entangled by plastic debris, which
            causes severe injuries and death.
            <br />
            - Plastic pollution threatens food safety and quality, human health,
            coastal tourism, and contributes to climate change.
            <br />
            - Plastic production contributes to climate change. If plastic waste
            is incinerated, it releases carbon dioxide and methane (from
            landfills) into the atmosphere, thereby increasing emissions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Plastic and climate change </b>
            <br />
            - As 99% of plastics are made from fossil feedstocks, plastic
            pollution is indubitably linked with climate change.
            <br />
            - Plastics are negatively affecting people and the environment at
            each stage of their lifecycle
            <br />
            - extraction of fossil fuel, production, manufacturing, use,
            recycling, and disposal. The impacts are felt in a wide range of
            areas, including on biodiversity, climate change, human health and
            human rights.
            <br />
            - Plastics are threatening the ability of the global community to
            keep global temperature rise below 1.5°C, as greenhouse gases (GHG)
            are emitted throughout the plastic life cycle.
            <br />
            - The rapid global growth of the plastic industry, largely fueled by
            natural gas, undermines efforts to reduce carbon pollution and
            prevent a climate catastrophe.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>6 reasons to blame plastic pollution for climate change </b>
            <br />
            - When not recycled or disposed of in a controlled manner, discarded
            plastic waste generates GHG emissions when exposed to solar
            radiation both in air and water.
            <br />
            - Marine plastic pollution breaks down into microplastics and
            contributes to climate change both through direct GHG emissions and
            indirectly by negatively affecting ocean organisms
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Ocean plastics pollution an overview: data and statistics</b>
            <br />
            - Microplastics are tiny particles of plastic that can be eaten by
            marine animals and end up in their bodies and tissues, entering the
            food chain and leading to disastrous consequences for the health of
            our planet and all its inhabitants.
            <br />
            - the presence of plastic in our ocean is continually increasing,
            and plastic pollution is still one of the main causes of marine
            species extinction, health problems for human beings and animals
            alike, and the destruction of our ecosystems.
            <br />
            - Plastic waste makes up 80% of all marine pollution and around 8 to
            10 million metric tons of plastic end up in the ocean each year.
            <br />
            - Research states that, by 2050, plastic will likely outweigh all
            fish in the sea.
            <br />
            - Plastic generally takes between 500-1000 years to degrade. Even
            then, it becomes microplastics, without fully degrading.
            <br />
            - Most of the plastic we find in the ocean comes from land: it flows
            downstream through rivers all the way to the sea. At first, it may
            stay in coastal waters, but it can soon be picked up by rotating
            ocean currents, called gyres, and transported literally anywhere in
            the world.
            <br />
            - When plastic waste is incinerated, it releases carbon dioxide and
            methane into the atmosphere, increasing emissions and worsening
            global warming.

          Using the Understanding Global Change icons, we can visualize the web
          of cause and effect relationships in the Earth system that result in
          global change. Below is a model explaining some of the cause and
          effect relationships relevant to sea level rise. An important cause of
          sea level rise is the burning of fossil fuels, which releases
          greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and through the greenhouse
          effect increases average global air temperatures. In turn, the higher
          air temperatures increase the melting rate of glaciers and ice caps
          (decreasing snow & ice cover), and the melted water contributes to sea
          level rise. The arrows show how these processes and phenomena are
          connected. We also included an icon to capture one of the consequences
          of sea level rise, the displace human populations around the world. As
          you build your own models, you can challenge yourself and your

          The world is now warming faster than at any point in human history.
          The effects are extreme weather like heavy rain or droughts, long-term
          shifts in weather patterns, melting ice and rising sea levels. Climate
          change is already having huge impacts on people and the environment
          worldwide. Human activities that release greenhouse gases need to be
          urgently curbed as much as possible to ensure a stable climate and
          safe world for everyone.

          <li>
            <b>Generating power</b>
            <br />
            Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels causes a
            large chunk of global emissions. Most electricity is still generated
            by burning coal, oil, or gas, which produces carbon dioxide and
            nitrous oxide – powerful greenhouse gases that blanket the Earth and
            trap the sun’s heat. Globally, a bit more than a quarter of
            electricity comes from wind, solar and other renewable sources
            which, as opposed to fossil fuels, emit little to no greenhouse
            gases or pollutants into the air.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Manufacturing goods</b>
            <br />
            Manufacturing and industry produce emissions, mostly from burning
            fossil fuels to produce energy for making things like cement, iron,
            steel, electronics, plastics, clothes, and other goods. Mining and
            other industrial processes also release gases, as does the
            construction industry. Machines used in the manufacturing process
            often run on coal, oil, or gas; and some materials, like plastics,
            are made from chemicals sourced from fossil fuels. The manufacturing
            industry is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas
            emissions worldwide.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Cutting down forests</b>
            <br />
            Cutting down forests to create farms or pastures, or for other
            reasons, causes emissions, since trees, when they are cut, release
            the carbon they have been storing. Each year approximately 12
            million hectares of forest are destroyed. Since forests absorb
            carbon dioxide, destroying them also limits nature’s ability to keep
            emissions out of the atmosphere. Deforestation, together with
            agriculture and other land use changes, is responsible for roughly a
            quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Using transportation</b>
            <br />
            Most cars, trucks, ships, and planes run on fossil fuels. That makes
            transportation a major contributor of greenhouse gases, especially
            carbon-dioxide emissions. Road vehicles account for the largest
            part, due to the combustion of petroleum-based products, like
            gasoline, in internal combustion engines. But emissions from ships
            and planes continue to grow. Transport accounts for nearly one
            quarter of global energy-related carbon-dioxide emissions. And
            trends point to a significant increase in energy use for transport
            over the coming years.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Producing food</b>
            <br />
            Producing food causes emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and
            other greenhouse gases in various ways, including through
            deforestation and clearing of land for agriculture and grazing,
            digestion by cows and sheep, the production and use of fertilizers
            and manure for growing crops, and the use of energy to run farm
            equipment or fishing boats, usually with fossil fuels. All this
            makes food production a major contributor to climate change. And
            greenhouse gas emissions also come from packaging and distributing
            food.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Powering buildings</b>
            <br />
            Globally, residential and commercial buildings consume over half of
            all electricity. As they continue to draw on coal, oil, and natural
            gas for heating and cooling, they emit significant quantities of
            greenhouse gas emissions. Growing energy demand for heating and
            cooling, with rising air-conditioner ownership, as well as increased
            electricity consumption for lighting, appliances, and connected
            devices, has contributed to a rise in energy-related carbon-dioxide
            emissions from buildings in recent years.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Consuming too much</b>
            <br />
            Your home and use of power, how you move around, what you eat and
            how much you throw away all contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.
            So does the consumption of goods such as clothing, electronics, and
            plastics. A large chunk of global greenhouse gas emissions are
            linked to private households. Our lifestyles have a profound impact
            on our planet. The wealthiest bear the greatest responsibility: the
            richest 1 per cent of the global population combined account for
            more greenhouse gas emissions than the poorest 50 per cent.

          Global temperatures rose about 1.98°Foffsite link (1.1°C) from 1901 to
          2020, but climate change refers to more than an increase in
          temperature. It also includes sea level rise, changes in weather
          patterns like drought and flooding, and much more. Things that we
          depend upon and value — water, energy, transportation, wildlife,
          agriculture, ecosystems, and human health — are experiencing the
          effects of a changing climate.

        <ul data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
          <li>
            <b>Hotter temperatures</b>
            <br />
            As greenhouse gas concentrations rise, so does the global surface
            temperature. The last decade, 2011-2020, is the warmest on record.
            Since the 1980s, each decade has been warmer than the previous one.
            Nearly all land areas are seeing more hot days and heat waves.
            Higher temperatures increase heat-related illnesses and make working
            outdoors more difficult. Wildfires start more easily and spread more
            rapidly when conditions are hotter. Temperatures in the Arctic have
            warmed at least twice as fast as the global average.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>More severe storms</b>
            <br />
            Destructive storms have become more intense and more frequent in
            many regions. As temperatures rise, more moisture evaporates, which
            exacerbates extreme rainfall and flooding, causing more destructive
            storms. The frequency and extent of tropical storms is also affected
            by the warming ocean. Cyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons feed on
            warm waters at the ocean surface. Such storms often destroy homes
            and communities, causing deaths and huge economic losses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Increased drought</b>
            <br />
            Climate change is changing water availability, making it scarcer in
            more regions. Global warming exacerbates water shortages in already
            water-stressed regions and is leading to an increased risk of
            agricultural droughts affecting crops, and ecological droughts
            increasing the vulnerability of ecosystems. Droughts can also stir
            destructive sand and dust storms that can move billions of tons of
            sand across continents. Deserts are expanding, reducing land for
            growing food. Many people now face the threat of not having enough
            water on a regular basis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>A warming, rising ocean</b>
            <br />
            The ocean soaks up most of the heat from global warming. The rate at
            which the ocean is warming strongly increased over the past two
            decades, across all depths of the ocean. As the ocean warms, its
            volume increases since water expands as it gets warmer. Melting ice
            sheets also cause sea levels to rise, threatening coastal and island
            communities. In addition, the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide, keeping
            it from the atmosphere. But more carbon dioxide makes the ocean more
            acidic, which endangers marine life and coral
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Loss of species</b>
            <br />
            Climate change poses risks to the survival of species on land and in
            the ocean. These risks increase as temperatures climb. Exacerbated
            by climate change, the world is losing species at a rate 1,000 times
            greater than at any other time in recorded human history. One
            million species are at risk of becoming extinct within the next few
            decades. Forest fires, extreme weather, and invasive pests and
            diseases are among many threats related to climate change. Some
            species will be able to relocate and survive, but others will not.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>More health risks</b>
            <br />
            Climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity.
            Climate impacts are already harming health, through air pollution,
            disease, extreme weather events, forced displacement, pressures on
            mental health, and increased hunger and poor nutrition in places
            where people cannot grow or find sufficient food. Every year,
            environmental factors take the lives of around 13 million people.
            Changing weather patterns are expanding diseases, and extreme
            weather events increase deaths and make it difficult for health care
            systems to keep up.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Hotter temperatures</b>
            <br />
            As greenhouse gas concentrations rise, so does the global surface
            temperature. The last decade, 2011-2020, is the warmest on record.
            Since the 1980s, each decade has been warmer than the previous one.
            Nearly all land areas are seeing more hot days and heat waves.
            Higher temperatures increase heat-related illnesses and make working
            outdoors more difficult. Wildfires start more easily and spread more
            rapidly when conditions are hotter. Temperatures in the Arctic have
            warmed at least twice as fast as the global average.

            <b>Not enough food</b>
            <br />
            Changes in the climate and increases in extreme weather events are
            among the reasons behind a global rise in hunger and poor nutrition.
            Fisheries, crops, and livestock may be destroyed or become less
            productive. With the ocean becoming more acidic, marine resources
            that feed billions of people are at risk. Changes in snow and ice
            cover in many Arctic regions have disrupted food supplies from
            herding, hunting, and fishing. Heat stress can diminish water and
            grasslands for grazing, causing declining crop yields and affecting
            livestock.
