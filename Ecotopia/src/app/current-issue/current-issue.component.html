              Climate change is happening now. Evidences being seen support the
              fact that the change cannot simply be explained by natural
              variation. The most recent scientific assessments have confirmed
              that this warming of the climate system since the mid-20th century
              is most likely to be due to human activities; and thus, is due to
              the observed increase in greenhouse gas concentrations from human
              activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and land use
              change. Current warming has increasingly posed quite considerable
              challenges to man and the environment, and will continue to do so
              in the future. Presently, some autonomous adaptation is taking
              place, but we need to consider a more pro-active adaptation
              planning in order to ensure sustainable development. What does it
              take to ensure that adaptation planning has a scientific basis?
              Firstly, we need to be able to investigate the potential
              consequences of anthropogenic or human induced climate change and
              to do this, a plausible future climate based on a reliable and
              accurate baseline (or present) climate must be constructed. This
              is what climate scientists call a climate change scenario. It is a
              projection of the response of the climate system to future
              emissions or concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols, and
              is simulated using climate models. Essentially, it describes
              possible future changes in climate variables (such as
              temperatures, rainfall, storminess, winds, etc.) based on baseline
              climatic conditions. The climate change scenarios outputs
              (projections) are an important step forward in improving our
              understanding of our complex climate, particularly in the future.
              These show how our local climate could change dramatically should
              the global community fail to act towards effectively reducing
              greenhouse gas emissions.

                As has been previously stated, climate change scenarios are
                developed using climate models (UNFCCC). These models use
                mathematical representations of the climate system, simulating
                the physical and dynamical processes that determine
                global/regional climate. They range from simple, one-dimensional
                models to more complex ones such as global climate models (known
                as GCMs), which model the atmosphere and oceans, and their
                interactions with land surfaces. They also model change on a
                regional scale (referred to as regional climate models),
                typically estimating change in areas in grid boxes that are
                approximately several hundred kilometers wide. It should be
                noted that GCMs/RCMs provide only an average change in climate
                for each grid box, although realistically climates can vary
                considerably within each grid. Climate models used to develop
                climate change scenarios are run using different forcings such
                as the changing greenhouse gas concentrations. These emission
                scenarios known as the SRES (Special Report on Emission
                Scenarios) developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
                Change (IPCC) to give the range of plausible future climate.
                These emission scenarios cover a range of demographic, societal,
                economic and technological storylines. They are also sometimes
                referred to as emission pathways. Table 1 presents the four
                different storylines (A1, A2, B1 and B2) as defined in the IPCC
                SRES.

                Climate change is driven by factors such as changes in the
                atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases and aerosols, land
                cover and radiation, and their combinations, which then result
                in what is called radiative forcing (positive or warming and
                negative or cooling effect). We do not know how these different
                drivers will specifically affect the future climate, but the
                model simulation will provide estimates of its plausible ranges.
                A number of climate models have been used in developing climate
                scenarios. The capacity to do climate modeling usually resides
                in advanced meteorological agencies and in international
                research laboratories for climate modeling such as the Hadley
                Centre for Climate Prediction and Research of the UK Met Office
                (in the United kingdom), the National Center for Atmospheric
                Research and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (in the
                United States), the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (in
                Germany), the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis
                (in Canada), the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
                Organization (in Australia), the Meteorological Research
                Institute of the Japan Meteorological Agency (in Japan), and
                numerous others. These centers have been developing their
                climate models and continuously generate new versions of these
                models in order address the limitations and uncertainties
                inherent in models.

                For the climate change scenarios in the Philippines presented in
                this Report, the PRECIS (Providing Regional Climates for Impact
                Studies) model was used. It is a PC-based regional climate model
                developed at the UK Met Office Hadley Centre for Climate
                Prediction and Research to facilitate impact, vulnerability and
                adaptation assessments in developing countries where capacities
                to do modeling are limited. Two time slices centered on 2020
                (2006-2035) and 2050 (2036-2065) were used in the climate
                simulations using three emission scenarios; namely, the A2
                (high-range emission scenario), the A1B (medium- range emission
                scenario) and the B2 (low-range emission scenario). The
                high-range emission scenario connotes that society is based on
                self-reliance, with continuously growing population, a
                regionally-oriented economic development but with fragmented per
                capita economic growth and technological change. On the other
                hand, the mid-range emission scenario indicates a future world
                of very rapid economic growth, with the global population
                peaking in mid-century and declining thereafter and there is
                rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies with
                energy generation balanced across all sources. The low-range
                emission scenario, in contrast, indicates a world with local
                solutions to economic, social, and environmental sustainability,
                with continuously increasing global population, but at a rate
                lower than of the high-range, intermediate levels of economic
                development, less rapid and more diverse technological change
                but oriented towards environment protection and social equity.
                To start the climate simulations or model runs, outputs (climate
                information) from the relatively coarse resolution GCMs are used
                to provide high resolution (using finer grid boxes, normally
                10km-100km) climate details, through the use of downscaling
                techniques. Downscaling is a method that derives local to
                regional scale (10km-100km x 10km-100km grids) information from
                larger-scale models (150km-300km x 150km-300km grids) as shown
                in Fig.1. The smaller the grid, the finer is the resolution
                giving more detailed climate information. The climate
                simulations presented in this report used boundary data that
                were from the ECHAM4 and HadCM3Q0 (the regional climate models
                used in the PRECIS model software).

                  To run regional climate models, boundary conditions are needed
                  in order to produce local climate scenarios. These boundary
                  conditions are outputs of the GCMs. For the PRECIS model, the
                  following boundary data and control runs were used:
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the high-range scenario, the GCM boundary data used was
                  from ECHAM4. This is the 4th generation coupled
                  ocean-atmosphere general circulation model, which uses a
                  comprehensive parameterization package developed at the Max
                  Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany.
                  Downscaling was to a grid resolution of 25km x 25km; thus,
                  allowing more detailed regional information of the projected
                  climate. Simulated baseline climate used for evaluation of the
                  models capacity of reproducing present climate was the
                  1971-2000 model run. Its outputs were compared with the
                  1971-2000 observed values.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the mid-range scenario, the GCM boundary data was from the
                  HadCM3Q0 version 3 of the coupled model developed at the
                  Hadley Centre. Downscaling was also to a grid resolution of
                  25km x 25km and the same validation process was undertaken.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For running the low-range scenario, the same ECHAM4 model was
                  used. However, the validation process was only for the period
                  of 1989 to 2000 because the available GCM boundary data in the
                  model was limited to this period.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The simulations for all 3 scenarios were for three periods;
                  1971 to 2000, 2020 and 2050. The period 1971 to 2000
                  simulation is referred to as the baseline climate, outputs of
                  which are used to evaluate the models capacity of reproducing
                  present climate (in other words, the control run). By
                  comparing the outputs (i.e., temperature and rainfall) with
                  the observed values for the 1971 to 2000 period, the models
                  ability to realistically represent the regional climatological
                  features within the country is verified. The differences
                  between the outputs and the observed values are called the
                  biases of the model. The 2020 and 2050 outputs are then
                  mathematically corrected, based on the comparison of the
                  models performance.

              <p>
                Modeling of our future climate always entails uncertainties.
                These are inherent in each step in the simulations/modeling done
                because of a number of reasons. Firstly, emissions scenarios are
                uncertain. Predicting emissions is largely dependent on how we
                can predict human behavior, such as changes in population,
                economic growth, technology, energy availability and national
                and international policies (which include predicting results of
                the international negotiations on reducing greenhouse gas
                emissions). Secondly, current understanding of the carbon cycle
                and of sources and sinks of non-carbon greenhouse gases are
                still incomplete. Thirdly, consideration of very complex
                feedback processes in the climate system in the climate models
                used can also contribute to the uncertainties in the outputs
                generated as these could not be adequately represented in the
                models.
              </p>
              <p>
                But while it is difficult to predict global greenhouse gas
                emission rates far into the future, it is stressed that
                projections for up to 2050 show little variation between
                different emission scenarios, as these near-term changes in
                climate are strongly affected by greenhouse gases that have
                already been emitted and will stay in the atmosphere for the
                next 50 years. Hence, for projections for the near-term until
                2065, outputs of the mid-range emission scenario are presented
                in detail in this Report.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ideally, numerous climate models and a number of the emission
                scenarios provided in the SRES should be used in developing the
                climate change scenarios in order to account for the limitations
                in each of the models used, and the numerous ways global
                greenhouse gas emissions would go. The different model outputs
                should then be analyzed to calculate the median of the future
                climate projections in the selected time slices. By running more
                climate models for each emission scenarios, the higher is the
                statistical confidence in the resulting projections as these
                constitute the ensemble representing the median values of the
                model outputs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The climate projections for the three emission scenarios were
                obtained using the PRECIS model only due to several constraints
                and limitations. These constraints and limitations are:
              </p>
              <p>
                Access to climate models: at the start, PAGASA had not accessed
                climate models due to computing and technical capacity
                requirements needed to run them;
              </p>
              <p>
                Time constraints: the use of currently available computers
                required substantial computing time to run the models (measured
                in weeks and months). This had been partly addressed under the
                capacity upgrading initiatives being implemented by the MDGF
                Joint Programme which include procurement of more powerful
                computers and acquiring new downscaling techniques. Improved
                equipment and new techniques have reduced the computing time
                requirements to run the models. However, additional time is
                still needed to run the models using newly acquired downscaling
                techniques; and
              </p>
              <p>
                The PAGASA strives to improve confidence in the climate
                projections and is continuously exerting efforts to upgrade its
                technical capacities and capabilities. Models are run as soon as
                these are acquired with the end-goal of producing an ensemble of
                the projections. Updates on the projections, including
                comparisons with the current results, will be provided as soon
                as these are available.

                The IPCC stresses that there is a large degree of uncertainty in
                predicting what the future world will be despite taking into
                account all reasonable future developments. Nevertheless, there
                is high confidence in the occurrence of global warming due to
                emissions of greenhouse gases caused by humans, as affirmed in
                the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Global climate
                simulations done to project climate scenarios until the end of
                the 21st century indicate that, although there are vast
                differences between the various scenarios, the values of
                temperature increase begin to diverge only after the middle of
                this century (shown in Fig.3). The long lifetimes of the
                greenhouse gases (in particular, that of carbon dioxide) already
                in the atmosphere is the reason for this behavior of this
                climate response to largely varying emission scenarios.

                  Model outputs that represent the plausible local climate
                  scenarios in this Report are indicative to the extent that
                  they reflect the large-scale changes (in the regional climate
                  model used) modified by the projected local conditions in the
                  country. It also should be stressed further that confidence in
                  the climate change information depends on the variable being
                  considered (e.g., temperature increase, rainfall change,
                  extreme event indices, etc.). In all the model runs regardless
                  of emission scenarios used, there is greater confidence in the
                  projections of mean temperature than that of the others. On
                  the other hand, projections of rainfall and extreme events
                  entail consideration of convective processes which are
                  inherently complex, and thus, limiting the degree of
                  confidence in the outputs.

              <p>
                The world has increasingly been concerned with the changes in
                our climate due largely to adverse impacts being seen not just
                globally, but also in regional, national and even, local scales.
                In 1988, the United Nations established the IPCC to evaluate the
                risks of climate change and provide objective information to
                governments and various communities such as the academe,
                research organizations, private sector, etc. The IPCC has
                successively done and published its scientific assessment
                reports on climate change, the first of which was released in
                1990. These reports constitute consensus documents produced by
                numerous lead authors, contributing authors and review experts
                representing Country Parties of the UNFCCC, including invited
                eminent scientists in the field from all over the globe.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2007, the IPCC made its strongest statement yet on climate
                change in its Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), when it concluded
                that the warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and that
                most of the warming during the last 50 years or so (e.g., since
                the mid-20th century) is due to the observed increase in
                greenhouse gas concentrations from human activities. It is also
                very likely that changes in the global climate system will
                continue into the future, and that these will be larger than
                those seen in our recent past (IPCC, 2007a).

                Fig.4 shows the 0.74 C increase in global mean temperature
                during the last 150 years compared with the 1961-1990 global
                average. It is the steep increase in temperature since the
                mid-20th century that is causing worldwide concern, particularly
                in terms of increasing vulnerability of poor developing
                countries, like the Philippines, to adverse impacts of even
                incremental changes in temperatures.

                However, there are differences between and within regions. For
                instance, in the Southeast Asia region which includes Indonesia,
                Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, among others,
                temperature increases have been observed; although magnitude
                varies from one country to another. Changes in rainfall
                patterns, characteristically defined by changes in monsoon
                performance, have also been noted. Analysis of trends of extreme
                daily events (temperatures and rainfall) in the Asia Pacific
                region (including Australia and New Zealand, and parts of China
                and Japan) also indicate spatial coherence in the increase of
                hot days, warm nights and heat waves, and the decrease of cold
                days, cold nights and frost; although, there is no definite
                direction of rainfall change across the entire region (Manton
                et. al., 2001).

                Analysis of trends of tropical cyclone occurrence or passage
                within the so-called Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR)
                show that an average of 20 tropical cyclones form and/or cross
                the PAR per year. The trend shows a high variability over the
                decades but there is no indication of increase in the frequency.
                However, there is a very slight increase in the number of
                tropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds of greater than
                150kph and above (typhoon category) being exhibited during El
                NiÑo event (See Fig.10).

                Moreover, the analysis on tropical cyclone passage over the
                three main islands (Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao), the 30-year
                running means show that there has been a slight increase in the
                Visayas during the 1971 to 2000 as compared with the 1951 to
                1980 and 1960-1990 periods (See Fig.11).

                To detect trends in extreme daily events, indices had been

                minimum temperatures (hot-days index and cold-nights index,
                respectively) show there are statistically significant
                increasing number of hot days but decreasing number of cool

                is already being experienced in most parts of the country, but
                not statistically significant (see in Fig.14). Likewise, the

              Projections on seasonal temperature increase and rainfall change,
              and total frequency of extreme events nationally and in the
              provinces using the mid-range scenario outputs are presented in
              this chapter. A comparison of these values with the high- and low-
              range scenarios in 2020 and 2050 is provided in the technical
              annexes.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is to be noted that all the projected changes are relative to
              the baseline (1971-2000) climate. For example, a projected 1.0
              C-increase in 2020 in a province means that 1.0 C is added to the
              baseline mean temperature value of the province as indicated in
              the table to arrive at the value of projected mean temperature.
              Therefore, if the baseline mean temperature is 27.8 C, then the
              projected mean temperature in the future is (27.8 C + 1.0 C) or
              28.8 C.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a similar manner, for say, a +25%-rainfall change in a
              province, it means that 25% of the seasonal mean rainfall value in
              the said province (from table of baseline climate) is added to the
              mean value. Thus, if the baseline seasonal rainfall is 900mm, then
              projected rainfall in the future is 900mm + 225mm or 1125mm.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means that we are already experiencing some of the climate
              change shown in the findings under the mid-range scenario, as we
              are now into the second decade of the century. Classification of
              climate used the Corona's four climate types (Types I to IV),
              based on monthly rainfall received during the year. A province is
              considered to have Type I climate if there is a distinct dry and a
              wet season; wet from June to November and dry, the rest of the
              year. Type II climate is when there is no dry period at all
              throughout the year, with a pronounced wet season from November to
              February. On the other hand, Type III climate is when there is a
              short dry season, usually from February to April, and Type IV
              climate is when the rainfall is almost evenly distributed during
              the whole year. The climate classification in the Philippines is
              shown in Fig.16.

                  All areas of the Philippines will get warmer, more so in the
                  relatively warmer summer months. Mean temperatures in all
                  areas in the Philippines are expected to rise by 0.9 C to 1.1
                  C in 2020 and by 1.8 C to 2.2 C in 2050. Likewise, all
                  seasonal mean temperatures will also have increases in these
                  time slices; and these increases during the four seasons are
                  quite consistent in all parts of the country. Largest

                    Generally, there is reduction in rainfall in most parts of
                    the country during the summer (MAM) season. However,
                    rainfall increase is likely during the southwest monsoon
                    (JJA) season until the transition (SON) season in most areas
                    of Luzon and Visayas, and also, during the northeast monsoon
                    (DJF) season, particularly, in provinces/areas characterized
                    as Type II climate in 2020 and 2050. There is however,
                    generally decreasing trend in rainfall in Mindanao,
                    especially by 2050.

                    There are varied trends in the magnitude and direction of
                    the rainfall changes, both in 2020 and 2050. What the
                    projections clearly indicate are the likely increase in the
                    performance of the southwest and the northeast monsoons in
                    the provinces exposed to these climate controls when they
                    prevail over the country. Moreover, the usually wet seasons
                    become wetter with the usually dry seasons becoming also
                    drier; and these could lead to more occurrences of floods

          <p>
            Climate change is one of the most fundamental challenges ever to
            confront humanity. Its adverse impacts are already being seen and
            may intensify exponentially over time if nothing is done to reduce
            further emissions of greenhouse gases. Decisively dealing NOW with
            climate change is key to ensuring sustainable development, poverty
            eradication and safeguarding economic growth. Scientific assessments
            indicate that the cost of inaction now will be more costly in the
            future. Thus, economic development needs to be shifted to a
            low-carbon emission path.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1992, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
            (UNFCCC) was adopted as the basis for a global response to the
            problem. The Philippines signed the UNFCCC on 12 June 1992 and
            ratified the international treaty on 2 August 1994. Presently, the
            Convention enjoys near-universal membership, with 194 Country
            Parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recognizing that the climate system is a shared resource which is
            greatly affected by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, the
            UNFCCC has set out an overall framework for intergovernmental
            efforts to consider what can be done to reduce global warming and to
            cope with whatever temperature increases are inevitable. Its
            ultimate objective is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in
            the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human
            interference with the climate system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Countries are actively discussing and negotiating ways to deal with
            the climate change problem within the UNFCCC using two central
            approaches. The first task is to address the root cause by reducing
            greenhouse gas emissions from human activity. The means to achieve
            this are very contentious, as it will require radical changes in the
            way many societies are organized, especially in respect to fossil
            fuel use, industry operations, land use, and development. Within the
            climate change arena, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is
            called mitigation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second task in responding to climate change is to manage its
            impacts. Future impacts on the environment and society are now
            inevitable, owing to the amount of greenhouse gases already in the
            atmosphere from past decades of industrial and other human
            activities, and to the added amounts from continued emissions over
            the next few decades until such time as mitigation policies and
            actions become effective. We are therefore committed to changes in
            the climate. Taking steps to cope with the changed climate
            conditions both in terms of reducing adverse impacts and taking
            advantage of potential benefits is called adaptation.

                    Responses of the local climate to the mid-range compared to
                    the high- and low-range scenarios are as shown in Fig. 22
                    below. Although there are vast differences in the
                    projections, the so-called temperature anomalies or
                    difference in surface temperature increase begin to diverge
                    only in the middle of the 21st century. As has already been
                    stated, the climate in the next 30 to 40 years is greatly
                    influenced by past greenhouse gas emissions. The long
                    lifetimes of the greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere,
                    with the exception of methane (with a lifetime of only 13
                    years), will mean that it will take at least 30 to 40 years
                    for the atmosphere to stabilize even if mitigation measures
                    are put in place, not withstanding that in the near future,
                    there could be some off-setting between sulfate aerosols
                    (cooling effect) and the greenhouse gas concentrations
                    (warming effect).

                  In areas/regions where rainfall is projected to decrease,
                  there will be water stress (both in quantity and quality),
                  which in turn, will most likely cascade into more adverse
                  impacts, particularly on forestry, agriculture and livelihood,
                  health, and human settlement. Large decreases in rainfall and
                  longer drier periods will affect the amount of water in
                  watersheds and dams which provide irrigation services to
                  farmers, especially those in rain fed areas, thereby, limiting
                  agricultural production. Likewise, energy production from dams
                  could also be rendered insufficient in those areas where
                  rainfall is projected to decrease, and thus, could largely
                  affect the energy sufficiency program of the country. Design
                  of infrastructure, particularly of dams, will need to be
                  re-visited to ensure that these will not be severely affected
                  by the projected longer drier periods.

                  In areas where rainfall could be intense during wet periods,
                  flooding events would follow and may pose danger to human
                  settlements and infrastructure, in terms of landslides and
                  mudslides, most especially, in geologically weak areas.
                  Additionally, these flooding events could impact severely on
                  public infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, including
                  classrooms, evacuation centers, and hospitals.

                  Adaptive capacity is enhanced when impact and vulnerability
                  assessments are used as the basis of strategic and long-term
                  planning for adaptation. Assessments would indicate areas
                  where critical water shortages can be expected leading to
                  possible reduction of water available for domestic
                  consumption, less irrigation service delivery, and possibly,
                  decreased energy generation in dams. Note that the adverse
                  impacts would cascade, so that long-term pro-active planning
                  for these possible impacts is imperative in order to be able
                  to respond effectively, and avoid maladaptations. A number of
                  adaptation strategies should be considered. Among the wide
                  array of cost effective options are rational water management,
                  planning to avoid mismatch between water supply and demand
                  through policies, upgrading/rehabilitation of dams where these
                  are cost-effective, changes in cropping patterns in
                  agricultural areas, establishing rain water collection
                  facilities, where possible, and early warning systems.

                  Changes in rainfall regimes and patterns resulting to
                  increase/decrease in water use and temperature increases could
                  lead to a change in the forests ecosystem, particularly in
                  areas where the rains are severely limited, and can no longer
                  provide favorable conditions for certain highly sensitive
                  species. Some of our forests could face die-backs.
                  Additionally, drier periods and warmer temperatures,
                  especially during the warm phase of El Nino events, could
                  cause forest fires. A very likely threat to communities that
                  largely depend on the ecological services provided by forests
                  is that they may face the need to alter their traditions and
                  livelihoods. This change in practices and behavior can lead to
                  further degradation of the environment as they resort to more
                  extensive agricultural production in already degraded areas.

                  Adverse impacts on forestry areas and resources could be
                  expected to multiply in a future warmer world. The value of
                  impact and vulnerability assessments could not be underscored.
                  These assessments would help decision makers and stakeholders
                  identify the best option to address the different impacts on
                  forest areas, watersheds and agroforestry. Indigenous
                  communities have to plan for climate-resilient alternative
                  livelihoods. Thus, it is highly important to plan for rational
                  forest management, particularly, in protected areas and in
                  ancestral domains. One of the more important issues to
                  consider is how to safeguard livelihoods in affected
                  communities so as not to further exacerbate land degradation.
                  Early warning systems in this sector will play a very
                  important role in forest protection through avoidance and
                  control/containment of forest fires.

                  Agriculture in the country could be severely affected by
                  temperature changes coupled with changes in rain regimes and
                  patterns. Crops have been shown to suffer decreases in yields
                  whenever temperatures have exceeded threshold values and
                  possibly result to spikelet sterility, as in the case of rice.
                  The reduction in crop yield would remain unmitigated or even
                  aggravated if management technologies are not put in place.
                  Additionally, in areas where rain patterns change or when
                  extreme events such as floods or droughts happen more often,
                  grain and other agricultural produce could suffer shortfalls
                  in the absence of effective and timely interventions. Tropical
                  cyclones, particularly if there will be an increase in numbers
                  and/or strength will continue to exert pressure on
                  agricultural production.

                  Moreover, temperature increases coupled with rainfall changes
                  could affect the incidence/outbreaks of pests and diseases,
                  both in plants and animals. The pathways through which
                  diseases and pests could be triggered and rendered most
                  favorable to spread are still largely unknown. It is therefore
                  important that research focus on these issues.

                  In the fisheries sub-sector, migration of fish to cooler and
                  deeper waters would force the fisher folks to travel further
                  from the coasts in order to increase their catch. Seaweed
                  production, already being practiced as an adaptation to
                  climate change in a number of poor and depressed coastal
                  communities could also be impacted adversely.

                  Decreased yields and inadequate job opportunities in the

                  population, resulting to more pressure in already depressed
                  urban areas, particularly in mega cities. Food security will
                  largely be affected, especially if timely, effective and
                  efficient interventions are not put in place. Insufficient
                  food supply could further lead to more malnutrition, higher
                  poverty levels, and possibly, heightened social unrest and
                  conflict in certain areas in the country, and even among the

                  A careful assessment of primary and secondary impacts in this
                  sector, particularly, in production systems and livelihoods
                  will go a long way in avoiding food security and livelihood
                  issues. Proactive planning (short- and long-term adaptation
                  measures) will help in attaining poverty eradication,
                  sufficient nutrition and secure livelihoods goals. There is a
                  wide cross-section of adaptation strategies that could be put
                  in place, such as horizontal and vertical diversification of
                  crops, farmer field schools which incorporate use of
                  weather/climate information in agricultural operations,
                  including policy environment for subsidies and
                  climate-friendly agricultural technologies, weather-based
                  insurance, and others. To date, there has not been much R&D

                  technologies, a research agenda on resilient marine sector

                  Human health is one of the most vital sectors which will be

              Scientific assessments have indicated that the Earth is now
              committed to continued and faster warming unless drastic global
              mitigation action is put in place the soonest. The likely impacts
              of climate change are numerous and most could seriously hinder the
              realization of targets set under the Millennium Development Goals;
              and thus, sustainable development. Under the UNFCCC, Country
              Parties have common but differentiated responsibilities. All
              Country Parties share the common responsibility of protecting the
              climate system but must shoulder different responsibilities. This
              means that the developed countries including those whose economies
              are in transition (or the so-called Annex 1 Parties) have an
              obligation to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions based on their
              emissions at 1990 levels and provide assistance to developing
              countries (or the so-called non-Annex 1 Parties) to adapt to
              impacts of climate change.

            <p>
              In addition, the commitment to mitigate or reduce anthropogenic
              greenhouse gas emissions by countries which share the
              responsibility of having historically caused this global problem,
              as agreed upon in the Kyoto Protocol, is dictated by the
              imperative to avoid what climate scientists refer to as the
              climate change tipping point. Tipping point is defined as the
              maximum temperature increase that could happen within the century,
              which could lead to sudden and dramatic changes to some of the
              major geophysical elements of the Earth. The effects of these
              changes could be varied from a dramatic rise in sea levels that
              could flood coastal regions to widespread crop failures. But, it
              still is possible to avoid them with cuts in anthropogenic
              greenhouse gases, both in the developed and developing countries,
              in particular, those which are now fast approaching the emission
              levels seen in rich countries.
