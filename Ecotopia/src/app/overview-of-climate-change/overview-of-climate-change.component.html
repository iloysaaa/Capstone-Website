        <p>
          Fracking is a controversial form of drilling that uses high-pressure
          liquid to create cracks in underground shale to extract natural gas
          and petroleum. Carbon emissions from fossils fuels like these have
          been linked to global warming and climate change.

        <h1>Climate Change Defined</h1>
        <p>
          Climate change is a long-term shift in global or regional climate
          patterns. Often climate change refers specifically to the rise in
          global temperatures from the mid-20th century to present.
        </p>

        <p>
          Climate is sometimes mistaken for weather. But climate is different
          from weather because it is measured over a long period of time,
          whereas weather can change from day to day, or from year to year. The
          climate of an area includes seasonal temperature and rainfall
          averages, and wind patterns. Different places have different climates.
          A desert, for example, is referred to as an arid climate because
          little water falls, as rain or snow, during the year. Other types of
          climate include tropical climates, which are hot and humid, and
          temperate climates, which have warm summers and cooler winters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Climate change is the long-term alteration of temperature and typical
          weather patterns in a place. Climate change could refer to a
          particular location or the planet as a whole. Climate change may cause
          weather patterns to be less predictable. These unexpected weather
          patterns can make it difficult to maintain and grow crops in regions
          that rely on farming because expected temperature and rainfall levels
          can no longer be relied on. Climate change has also been connected
          with other damaging weather events such as more frequent and more
          intense hurricanes, floods, downpours, and winter storms.
        </p>
        <p>
          In polar regions, the warming global temperatures associated with
          climate change have meant ice sheets and glaciers are melting at an
          accelerated rate from season to season. This contributes to sea levels
          rising in different regions of the planet. Together with expanding
          ocean waters due to rising temperatures, the resulting rise in sea
          level has begun to damage coastlines as a result of increased flooding
          and erosion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cause of current climate change is largely human activity, like
          burning fossil fuels, like natural gas, oil, and coal. Burning these
          materials releases what are called greenhouse gases into Earth’s
          atmosphere. There, these gases trap heat from the sun’s rays inside
          the atmosphere causing Earth’s average temperature to rise. This rise
          in the planet's temperature is called global warming. The warming of
          the planet impacts local and regional climates. Throughout Earth's
          history, climate has continually changed. When occuring naturally,
          this is a slow process that has taken place over hundreds and
          thousands of years. The human influenced climate change that is
          happening now is occuring at a much faster rate.
