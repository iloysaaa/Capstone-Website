        <h1>History of climate change science</h1>
        <p>
          The history of the scientific discovery of climate change began in the
          early 19th century when ice ages and other natural changes in
          paleoclimate were first suspected and the natural greenhouse effect
          was first identified. In the late 19th century, scientists first
          argued that human emissions of greenhouse gases could change Earth's
          energy balance and climate. Many other theories of climate change were
          advanced, involving forces from volcanism to solar variation. In the
          1960s, the evidence for the warming effect of carbon dioxide gas
          became increasingly convincing. Some scientists also pointed out that
          human activities that generated atmospheric aerosols (e.g.,
          "pollution") could have cooling effects as well.<br /><br />During the
          1970s, scientific opinion increasingly favored the warming viewpoint.
          By the 1990s, as the result of improving the fidelity of computer
          models and observational work confirming the Milankovitch theory of
          the ice ages, a consensus position formed: greenhouse gases were
          deeply involved in most climate changes and human-caused emissions
          were bringing discernible global warming. Since the 1990s, scientific
          research on climate change has included multiple disciplines and has
          expanded. Research has expanded our understanding of causal relations,
          links with historic data, and abilities to measure and model climate
          change. Research during this period has been summarized in the
          Assessment Reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
          Change.<br /><br />
          Climate change, broadly interpreted, is a significant and lasting
          change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over
          periods ranging from decades to millions of years. It may be a change
          in average weather conditions or in the distribution of weather around
          the average conditions (such as more or fewer extreme weather events).
          Climate change is caused by factors that include oceanic processes
          (such as oceanic circulation), biotic processes (e.g., plants),
          variations in solar radiation received by Earth, plate tectonics and
          volcanic eruptions, and human-induced alterations of the natural
          world. This last effect is currently causing global warming, and
          "climate change" is often used to describe human-specific impacts.

        <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Climate Change discoveries</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>1938 - Proof that global temperatures are rising</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Steam engineer Callendar made the decision to take a break from his
          regular work in 1938 and started methodically compiling data from 147
          weather stations throughout the world. He conducted all of his
          calculations by hand and found that, over the previous 50 years, the
          average world temperature had increased by 0.3°C.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>1954 - The birth of the solar cell</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Bell Labs, the research division of the Bell Telephone Company in New
          Jersey, requested assistance from engineer Daryl Chapin in 1952 to
          address a challenge. The business sought to expand its telephone
          network into isolated tropical areas. The conventional batteries used
          at the time weren't adequate, though, as they deteriorated too quickly
          in the hot, muggy weather. When Chapin was requested to investigate
          other power sources, he thought solar power might be an option.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>1958 - CO2 levels are rising, and fossil fuels are to blame</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dr Charles David Keeling provides the first evidence that CO2 levels
          are rising In 1958, a young postgraduate geochemist called Charles
          David Keeling decided to compare the amounts of CO2in water and air.
          Nobody had ever really tried to measure the level of CO2 in the
          atmosphere before, so there was no off-the-shelf equipment he could
          use. He designed his own apparatus and set off to a weather
          observation station on the top of the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii.
          Once there, he took meticulous measurements every day and within five
          years he had provided the first unequivocal proof that CO2
          concentrations were rising. What’s more, by analysing the CO2 in his
          samples, Dr Keeling was able to attribute this rise to the use of
          fossil fuels.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>1967 - Earth’s changing climate modelled for first time</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The first climate computer model of the planet Earth is produced by
          scientists. According to the model, doubling CO2 concentrations might
          result in a 2°C increase in global temperatures. Researchers Richard
          Wetherald and Syukuro Manabe created the first precise computer model
          of Earth's climate in 1967. The atmosphere, seas, clouds, and their
          interactions with one another were all considered as part of the
          model's analysis of the various climate-related factors.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>1968 - Scientist predicts melting ice caps</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          A catastrophic rise in sea levels could result from the loss of the
          Antarctic ice sheets, according to Dr. John Mercer, a glaciologist at
          Ohio State University in Columbus. Dr. Mercer found signs of a former
          freshwater lake while conducting fieldwork at the Reedy Glacier in
          West Antarctica in 1968. The lake's remnants were located 1,400 meters
          above sea level in the Transantarctic Mountains. Dr. Mercer saw this
          as proof that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet as a whole once melted
          away, which was previously thought to be impossible.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          1969 - Earth’s temperature measured with satellites for first time
        </h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Launch of NASA's Nimbus III satellite into orbit, which delivers the
          first precise measurement of air temperatures on a worldwide scale.
          How scientists investigate the Earth's climate, weather patterns, and
          atmosphere has been transformed by the Nimbus satellites. The series
          of satellites, which were first launched in 1964, gave us access to
          previously unobtainable information on global temperatures, the amount
          of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the ozone layer, and the
          thickness of sea ice over the course of 30 years. Additionally, it
          made it feasible for scientists to create computer models that could
          predict the weather up to two weeks in advance, something that was
          previously almost impossible.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>1985 - Drilling 150,000 years deeper into the ice</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The previous 150,000 years have seen an ups and downs in CO2 and
          temperature, according to ice cores from Antarctica. Ice cores provide
          key information about what the Earth’s climate was like in the past. A
          special snapshot of the environment at the moment can be found in
          bubbles sealed in the ice. By examining the proportion of "heavy"
          oxygen and hydrogen atoms, scientists can also determine historical
          surface temperatures.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>1985 - Ozone hole discovery</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Scientists discover a hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica. We are
          naturally shielded from harmful ultraviolet (UV) light by the ozone
          layer in the Earth's atmosphere. Therefore, the world was astonished
          to learn in 1985 that three BAS scientists had discovered very low
          ozone levels above the South Pole.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>1985 - The lithium-ion battery is invented</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Professor Akira Yoshino, a physicist from Japan, creates the initial
          rechargeable lithium battery. The compact battery starts a revolution
          in energy storage that eventually powers portable electronics like
          laptops and mobile phones.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          1988 - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) heralds a
          new era of climate research
        </h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The IPCC regularly provides policymakers with scientific assessments
          on the level of our understanding of climate change. The
          Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the UN agency
          tasked with evaluating the science relating to climate change. It was
          established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the
          World Meteorological Organization (WMO). 
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>1991 - Wind power takes off in the UK</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The first wind farm in the UK is being built in Cornwall, and it
          consists of 10 turbines that combined can power about 2,700
          households. The Edwards family finished and launched the UK's first
          commercial wind farm, Delabole Wind Farm, in North Cornwall in 1991.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>1992 - Coral reefs at threa</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Scientists are aware that corals and other creatures will find it more
          difficult to form reefs as ocean CO2 levels rise. The ocean's water
          becomes more acidic as a result of CO2 dissolving there. This prevents
          corals from ingesting calcium carbonate, a necessary mineral that they
          need to form their skeletons.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>1994 - First climate change legislation comes into force</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          197 nations ratify the first global agreement to fight climate change.
          The first worldwide agreement to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and
          stop climate change was the United Nations Framework Convention on
          Climate Change (UNFCCC). 197 nations have ratified it, and it came
          into effect on March 21st, 1994.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>1996 - Capturing carbon underground</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The first carbon storage project in history begins. When greenhouse
          gases produced by factories, power plants, and other sources are taken
          and stored underground, this process is known as carbon capture (CC).
          As a result, there is no longer any CO2 emitted into the atmosphere,
          halting future global warming.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>2003 - Scientists link extreme weather to climate change</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          A heatwave in Europe kills tens of thousands of people – scientists
          say that climate change is to blame.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          2007 - The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet
        </h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          arctic bears and other species are at risk because the arctic areas
          are warming up twice as quickly as the rest of the planet. The
          greatest investigation of the polar areas of Earth was carried out
          during the International Polar Year 2007–2008. In order to discover
          the mysteries of the Arctic and Antarctic, approximately 50,000
          scientists, students, and support personnel from over 60 countries
          gathered. What they discovered was disturbing. Parts of the Antarctic
          ice sheet, the Greenland ice sheet, and the Arctic sea ice are all
          melting at rates that have never been seen in the previous 10,000
          years.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>2008 - The UK Climate Change Act is enshrined in law</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Act becomes the world’s first long-term legally binding framework
          for tackling climate change The Act requires the government to set
          binding five-year carbon budgets based on the latest science.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          2015 - Landmark international Paris agreement reached to cut carbon
        </h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Paris Agreement is ratified by 196 nations, which commits them to
          keeping global warming to less than 2°C over pre-industrial levels. An
          international agreement on climate change that is legally binding is
          the Paris Agreement. It was approved by 196 nations on December 12th,
          2015, and went into effect on November 4th, 2016. The target is to
          keep warming to 1.5°C below pre-industrial levels.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>2019 - Ice collapse ‘irreversible’</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Greenland's and Antarctica's ice sheets may already be past the point
          of no return, and their collapse might result in a 10 meter rise in
          sea level. According to a special assessment by the Intergovernmental
          Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Amundsen Sea embayment of West
          Antarctica, a portion of an ice sheet, may already have reached a
          tipping point and collapse is now certain.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>2019 - UK first country to pass net zero emissions law</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The UK is the first developed nation to adopt regulations requiring
          large economies to reduce their contributions to global warming by
          2050. The UK pledged in 2019 to achieve net zero greenhouse gas
          emissions by 2050. When the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions
          created and those taken out of the atmosphere are equal, the situation
          is known as net zero.

        <h3>
          2019 - Variety of life on Earth being lost at “unprecedented” pace
        </h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Currently, up to one million animal and plant species are in danger of
          going extinct, and many of them might do so over the next few decades.
          The number of native species on the earth has drastically decreased
          since 1900, according to a 2019 UN report. The study is the most
          thorough analysis of world biodiversity that has ever been done, and
          it was prepared by 145 specialists from 50 different nations.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>2020 - World record set for solar power</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          With a cell that can convert 29.52% of solar energy into electricity,
          Oxford PV, an Oxford University spinoff firm, establishes a global
          record.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>
          2021 - Many aspects of climate change are now inevitable and
          irreversible
        </h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          By 2040, the earth will have warmed by 1.5C, according to scientists,
          defying past predictions. At that rate of warming, there will be an
          increase in heatwaves, severe storms, droughts, and flooding. The
          results are detailed in the IPCC's most recent Assessment Report,
          which is the premier source of information on climate science
          worldwide. The study issues the experts' most stern warning to date on
          the growing climate disaster. It issues a warning that we are already
          witnessing climatic shifts that have not been seen in thousands, if
          not hundreds of thousands of years.
